Function ACQUIRE-LOCK

Syntax:

  acquire-lock lock &key wait => success

Arguments and Values:

  lock - a lock.
  wait - a generalized boolean. Default is false.
  success - a generalized boolean.

Description:

  Attempts to acquire the lock for the current thread.

  If the lock is held and wait is false, returns false. If the lock is held by
  another thread and wait is true, waits for the lock to be released, acquires
  it, and then returns true.

  The lock release immediately prior to a lock acquisition in the lock's
  modification order, if there is one, synchronizes-with the lock acquisition.
  [Since these terms are used in multiple places, "lock release" and "lock
   acquisition" may warrant glossary entries.]

  The consequences are undefined if wait is true and the lock is held by the
  current thread.
