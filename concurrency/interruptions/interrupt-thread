Function INTERRUPT-THREAD

Syntax:

  interrupt-thread thread &optional datum &rest arguments => interrupt

Arguments and Values:

  thread - a thread.
  datum, arguments - designators for a condition of default type
                     SIMPLE-INTERRUPT.
  interrupt - an interrupt.

Description:

  Adds the designated INTERRUPT to the thread's pending interrupt list. Returns
  the interrupt.

  Calls to INTERRUPT-THREAD synchronize-with calls to SIGNAL-PENDING-INTERRUPTS
  in the thread that signal the designated interrupt. [Technically I think an
  implementation could be very slightly more efficiently by skipping this, but
  that seems needlessly confusing.]

  Conforming code must ensure that the same interrupt object is not used to
  interrupt multiple threads, or to interrupt the same thread more than once.
  [This condition is in place so that a thread can use DELETE or something...
   which is a dumb reason, so maybe this should be removed. Alternately so that
   an interrupt's rejection status can be stored in the thread itself? If there
   is an interrupt status that would get weird with multiply used interruptions
   regardless.]

  A thread may interrupt itself. This does not behave differently from any
  other interruption, except that no synchronization is necessary.

Exceptional Situations:

  If the designated condition is not of type INTERRUPT, an error of type
  TYPE-ERROR is signaled.

  If the thread is no longer alive, an error of type THREAD-DEAD is signaled.
