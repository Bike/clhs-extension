Standard Generic Function SERVICE-INTERRUPT

Syntax:

  service-interrupt interrupt => implementation-dependent

Method Signatures:

  service-interrupt (interrupt destruction-interrupt)
  service-interrupt (interrupt call-interrupt)
  service-interrupt (interrupt interactive-interrupt)

Arguments and Values:

  interrupt - an interrupt.
  values - objects; see below.

Description:

  Performs the interrupt's associated action.

  The method on DESTRUCTION-INTERRUPT effectively calls ABORT-THREAD with the
  interrupt as its condition. This ends the thread, so control does not return
  from SERVICE-INTERRUPT.

  The method on CALL-INTERRUPT calls the function associated with the interrupt
  with no arguments.

  The method on INTERACTIVE-INTERRUPT works similarly to BREAK. The method
  effectively calls INVOKE-DEBUGGER on the interrupt. If the CONTINUE restart
  is used while in the debugger, SERVICE-INTERRUPT immediately returns NIL.
  *DEBUGGER-HOOK* is bound to NIL before the debugger is entered.

  SERVICE-INTERRUPT is called from SIGNAL-PENDING-INTERRUPTS. It is not intended
  to be called by programmers, but they may define methods for it.

Side Effects:

  Vary.
