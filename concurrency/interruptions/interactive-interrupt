Condition Type INTERACTIVE-INTERRUPT

Class Precedence List:

  INTERACTIVE-INTERRUPT, INTERRUPT, CONDITION, T

Description:

  Represents a thread being interrupted by an invocation of the debugger. This
  could be issued to a thread when the user wishes to interrupt a running
  thread, for example.


  [BREAK-INTERRUPT might be a better name, since invoking the debugger isn't
   necessarily interactive?]
