Function THREAD-ALIVE-P

Syntax:

  thread-alive-p thread => alivep

Arguments and Values:

  thread - a thread.
  alivep - a generalized boolean.

Description:

  Checks whether the given thread is alive, i.e. has not finished.

  The final evaluation in the thread synchronizes-with any call to this function
  on the thread returning true.

  [If it is possible to create but not start threads, this would require a
   little rewriting. Several implementations support that, but I don't
   understand the value.]
