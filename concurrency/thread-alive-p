Function THREAD-ALIVE-P

Syntax:

  thread-alive-p thread => alivep

Arguments and Values:

  thread - a thread.
  alivep - a generalized boolean.

Description:

  Checks whether the given thread is alive, i.e. has not finished.

  The final evaluation in the thread synchronizes-with any call to this function
  on the thread returning false.

  [If it is possible to create but not start threads, this would require a
   little rewriting. Several implementations support that, but I don't
   understand the value.]

  JOIN-THREAD

Notes:

  Because calls to this function that return true are not synchronized, a true
  result may be invalid as soon as it's returned, i.e. the thread could die
  between THREAD-ALIVE-P determining that it's alive and returning. Conforming
  code cannot assume a thread other than the current thread is alive unless
  there is other synchronization.
