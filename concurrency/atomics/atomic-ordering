The ordering of an atomic access defines its behavior when there is a conflict
with another access. Orderings define various levels of synchronization, and of
constraints on pairing between reads and writes.

Some orderings are "stronger" than others, in that they have strictly more
requirements than the "weaker" ordering. In this sense, relaxed is stronger than
unordered, acquire and release and acquire-release are all stronger than
relaxed, and sequential consistency is stronger than all the rest.

If two atomic accesses conflict, only the requirements of the weaker ordering
are necessarily respected.
